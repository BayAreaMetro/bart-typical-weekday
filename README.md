# bart-typical-weekday
Typical weekday summaries of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) boardings and alightings.  For transportation planning purposes, we seek to understand 'typical' weekday behavior, which we define here to occur non-Holiday Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in the months of March, April, May, September, October, and November.  Methods herein strive to process data provided by BART to inform estimates of typical weekday travel conditions through time.

The `Consume` directory processes a year's worth of data and then combines the annual summaries into two separate databases: one for typical weekdays and one with all the days.  The 'Summaries' directory contains a Tableau workbook presenting the data; an interactive version of the Tableau dashboard is [here](http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/Main/TypicalWeekdayBart). The data is available in the 'bart-typical-weekday' folder [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/share-data).
